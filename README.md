# React Formik forms

A simple React application for Signup and Signin forms made using [Formik](https://formik.org/) along with Validation provided by [Yup](https://github.com/jquense/yup). The app is built using [Vite](https://vite.dev/) for fast development and optimized builds and written in **Typescript** for type safety.

## Design

The form consists of a simple design with a logo at the top, and a form toggle at the bottom to swtich between login and signup forms. The form inputs are seperated into rows, and placeholders are used for a clean look. Subtle animations are used for a better visual experience. A custom toast has been provided to indicate the success or errors in the form submission.
